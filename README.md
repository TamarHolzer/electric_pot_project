The electric pot project is a project conducted during an electronics course within the curriculum of software engineering - chips.
The electric pot will manage the cooking process for you so that you can perform additional actions while cooking without unnecessary worries.
In order to carry out the project I used an ARDUINO micro controller card
LCD touch screen
And I used the sensors:
LM75 temperature sensor
Water level sensor
and an LED bar to simulate flames.
The pot is programmed so that the user selects the desired low/medium/high cooking power and thus the cooking time. and after clicking OK
The flames are lit so that whenever the temperature is lower than the desired temperature, the flames will be strong,
but if the temperature rises more than necessary, the flames weaken and even if the water level exceeds a certain level, the dish may overflow, therefore the flames will be lower even in such a situation.
